## <a name="overview"></a>Overview
What are the best neighbourhoods in Toronto to open up a restaurant business? Choosing a new restaurant location is the most important, at the same time, the most difficult decision throughout the whole process. Our goal for this project is to create a dashboard page with multiple interactive graphs and maps that gives an insight at restaurant data as well as neighbourhood information in Toronto. The dashboard would help new restaurant owners decide as to where the best placement of a new restaurant could be considering ethnicity, local competition, income and crime rate per neighborhood to help determine whether a restaurant could potentially be profitable or not for each neighborhood.

## Research Question
What are the best neighbourhoods in Toronto to open up a restaurant business? </br>
Based on: </br>
- Ethnicity of Population per neighbourhood </br>
- Competition for a given Restaurant Category per neighbourhood </br>
- Distribution of Price Range per neighbourhood </br>
- Average/Median Income, Average Crime Rate for all Neighbourhoods in Toronto and corresponding Number of Restaurants.

  ## ðŸ”­ ETL Process
  ### Extract
  Data sourced from
  ### Transform
  Data cleaned and transformed by using Python Jupyter Notebook.
  ### Load
  - This project used Python Jupyter Notebook to load transformed data in to PostgreSQL database.
  - Python Flaskâ€“powered RESTful API were used to deploy the data into the web, and API end point links created. API links store our cleaned and transformed data in json format and are publicly accessible for visitors of our website.
  
  ## <a name="data-visualization"></a>Data Visualization
  ### [1] <a name="map"></a>Toronto Neighbourhood Map 
  * A Toronto Neighbourhood Geomap was created using Leaflet. Other graphs which give restaurant data as well as neighbourhood information in Toronto are connected to this core map. The user picks a nighbourhood by clicking on a map.

  ### [2] <a name="interactive-map"></a>Toronto Neighbourhood Overview 
  * A interactive scatter plot was created using the D3 techniques, It displays Average, Median Income and Average Crime Rate for all neighbourhoods in Toronto and corresponding number of restaurants. Furthermore, Selected neighbourhood information(Average/Median income, Crime rate) is displayed on Panel.

  ### [3] <a name="ethnicity"></a>Totonro Ethinicty in Each Neighbourhood 
  * The selected neighbourhood information from Toronto Geomap is passed into the ethnicity. The Toronto Ethnicity Barchart is created and annotated from API calls with labels, text and hover information. Bar graph represents the ethnicity of each region in Toronto.

  ### [4] <a name="restaurant2"></a>Toronto Restaurant Categories and Price Range 
  * The selected neighhourhood information is also passed into the price range routes which will then run a query to the PostgreSQL Database via SQLAlchemy to fetch their corresponding data for the neighbourhood selected on the map. The data returned was used to generate a D3 barchart for Category--Restaurant Number and for Price Range--Restaurant Number.

  ## Data Analysis
  Neighbourhoods like Bridle Path Sunnybrook York Mills and Lawrence Park South are the optimal places/neighbourhoods to open up a restaurant.
  For the following reasons:
  - Both neighbourhoods have the highest Average Income, Median Income.
  - They have comparitively very low number of restaurants than other neighbourhoods at 4 and 15 respectively.
  - The Crime Rate in these neighbourhoods is very low making them a safer option.
  Additionally, we can also see that both these neighbourhoods are highly populated with european origins followed by asian origins, ideal for opening similar ethnic cuisines.
  If you further drill down for Bridle Path Sunnybrook York Mills 
  for Lawrence PArk South,
